# NetworkHw

a Homework that was required during the first weeks of the semester in our networks 101 course.
the idea is just a console application that represents either a [TCP](https://github.com/HuangLinBao/NetworkHw) or a [UDP](https://github.com/HuangLinBao/NetworkHwUdp) client that sends a course number to a [TCP Server](https://github.com/HuangLinBao/NetworkServerHw) or a [UDP Server](https://github.com/HuangLinBao/NetworkHwUDPserver) respectively.

the server code reads a text file then identifies if the course with the given number exisits or not and responds back to the client.
